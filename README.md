# Learn-Direct3D-11

This project is made to learn the Odin programming language and Direct3D 11.

The design of the code tries to improve on my previous rendrerer : https://github.com/St0wy/opengl-scene.

## Want to do

- [x] Window Resizing
- [x] First version of a Material system
- [ ] Separate the notion of a material / pipeline from the renderer and give an API to create shaders
- [ ] Scene graph
- [ ] Camera controls
- [ ] ImGui
- [ ] Perf counter with CPU / GPU Time
- [ ] Option to change resolution
- [ ] Obj Model Loading
- [ ] Point lights
- [ ] PBR
- [ ] HDR / [Tonemapping](https://64.github.io/tonemapping/)
- [ ] GLTF Model Loading
- [ ] Cascaded Shadow Mapping
- [ ] Some post processing effects (SSAO ? Bloom ?)
- [ ] Not sure yet if I want to make the renderer deffered yet, but maybe (or forward +?)
