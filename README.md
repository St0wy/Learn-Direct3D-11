# Learn-Direct3D-11

This project is made to learn the Odin programming language and Direct3D 11.

The design of the code tries to improve on my previous rendrerer : https://github.com/St0wy/opengl-scene.

## Want to do

- [x] Window Resizing
- [x] First version of a Material system
- [ ] Camera controls
- [ ] Scene graph
- [ ] OBJ Model Loading
- [ ] ImGui
- [ ] Perf counter with CPU / GPU Time
- [ ] Option to change internal resolution
- [ ] Some debugging tools (Seeing normals, depths buffers, bounding boxes, wireframe)
- [ ] Mip Mapping
- [ ] Point lights and Blinn-Phong
- [ ] Cascaded Shadow Maps
- [ ] Texture Compression
- [ ] PBR ? Without IBL
- [ ] HDR / [Tonemapping](https://64.github.io/tonemapping/)
- [ ] GLTF Model Loading
- [ ] Cascaded Shadow Mapping
- [ ] Some post processing effects (SSAO ? Bloom ?)
- [ ] FXAA
- [ ] Not sure yet if I want to make the renderer deffered yet, but maybe (or forward +?)

At some point somewhere maybe : Deferred rendering

If I have that dawg in me : Skeletal animation
